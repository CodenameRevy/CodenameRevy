### Hi, I'm Marko, also known as Revy online :)

Student at School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Applied Studies in Belgrade, Serbia! 👨‍🎓

I'm interested in software development, robotics, animation and CGI and music samples production! I am currently learning a few different programming languages, and I'm very excited to learn more!

I'm currently mostly wokring on some small Minecraft mods for a hobby.
